# Assetto Corsa Competizione - Window Manager
 
Assetto Corsa Competizione in its current state does not support Multi-Monitor usage natively. This ultimately resulted in the usage of Third-Party Applications, ex. [SRWE](https://github.com/dtgDTGdtg/SRWE), which highly inspired the development of this more-specialized application. Ultimately the goal is to provide a near-seamless experience and integration with Assetto Corsa Competizione and provide the most popular presets.

Feel free to [Open issues](https://github.com/kristofkerekes/acc-windowmanager/issues) of bugs that you encounter, or suggestions that float your boat. Also hop into the conversation on the [Reddit thread]() to have a word in the future of this project.
 
 # Features
 
 ## Apply window settings
 
 You can choose from numerous presets that support different resolutions and primary monitor choices.
 * Triple Monitors - 3x1080p
 * Triple Monitors - 3x1440p
 * Triple Monitors - 3x1080p (Offset Left)
 * Triple Monitors - 3x1080p (Offset Right)
 * Triple Monitors - 3x1440p (Offset Left)
 * Triple Monitors - 3x1440p (Offset Right)

The Offset Left/Right settings are aimed at users with more output devices or setups with primary monitors not chosen as the monitor in the middle. Experiment with these settings if you want to offset the position of the Assetto Corsa Competizione window by a monitor to the left or right. This is aimed to eliminate the fiddling with ***Win Key + Arrow*** combinations upon starting the game.

## Launch Assetto Corsa Competizione from Window Manager

If you managed to resize the window of Assetto Corsa Competizione successfully on a previous occasion, Window Manager will remember the location of your game and be able to launch and resize it via a push of a single button. If you have Steam running on your computer already, it only takes a single click of a button to enjoy your game on all monitors.

## Automatically attach to Assetto Corsa Competizione
 
Whether you started Window Manager or Assetto Corsa Competizione first, Window Manager will detect the presence of the game and automatically resize its window to your preferred size.
 
 ## Remember previously used settings
 
 No need to fiddle around with settings every time you want to launch Assetto Corsa Competizione, your previously used settings are saved and reloaded every time you launch Window Manager.
 
 # Future ideas
* Tray Application to better support startup with system
* Launching Steam instead of erroring-out
* Extend support to more presets
